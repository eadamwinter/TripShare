# TripShare
<p>This is my first more complex application based on an app that I had on my phone to share costs.
I was intrested how it works so I decided to write one on my own.</p>

<p>TripShare allows to add group of friends, add expenses and then calculate the results (debts between members of the group). There is also a possibility to edit
or remove expenses and groups.</p>

During the work on this project I practiced :
<ol>
<li>ASP.NET Core/C#</li>
<li>Entity Framework Core</li>
<li>Unit tests (Including using InMemory database tests)</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>CSS/HTML</li>
</ol>
